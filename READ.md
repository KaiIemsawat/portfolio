## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `"npm start"`,

The app is built using `vite` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser. Since (at this state) the app is focus on frontend, you may only run `npm start` from `portfolio-project` directory

### `"npm run build"`,
